## 2025-12-05

- **FIX:** Resolved issue where `/focusanime/:animeId` API endpoint was returning null values.
- **FEAT:** Implemented client-side logic in `public/animefetcher.js` to fetch and display anime details dynamically on the `/anime/:animeId` page.
- **FIX:** Registered Handlebars 'json' helper in `app.js` to resolve 'Missing helper: json' error on anime details page for logged-in users.
- **FIX:** Updated Content Security Policy (CSP) in `app.js` to allow connections to `https://unpkg.com`, resolving dashboard loading issues.
- **FEAT:** Implemented commenting system for anime pages.
    - Added `comments` table to `database_creation.sql`.
    - Added `role` column to `user` table in `database_creation.sql` for RBAC.
    - Updated `user_inserts.sql` to assign 'admin' role to 'mirkolouis' and 'user' role to others.
    - Implemented API endpoints for comments:
        - `GET /api/anime/:animeId/comments` (accessible to all users).
        - `POST /api/anime/:animeId/comments` (requires logged-in user).
        - `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` (requires admin role).
    - Added `ensureAdmin` middleware in `controllers/auth.js` for RBAC.
    - Updated frontend (`views/anime_details.hbs` and `public/animefetcher.js`) to display comments, show conditional comment form (login prompt for guests), and enable admin-only comment deletion.
- **FEAT:** Improved layout of anime details page (`views/anime_details.hbs`).
    - Reduced banner height to 1/4 of its previous height.
    - Reorganized anime image and title to be closer using a flexbox layout.
- **FIX:** Added theme switching functionality to `views/anime_details.hbs`.
- **FEAT:** Made "View Details" button in spotlight the same size as "Add to Watchlist" button.
- **FEAT:** Updated `autoinsert2.py` to `autoinsert3.py`. The new script dynamically generates studio and tag maps from their respective `.sql` files, making the data seeding process more self-contained. Also updated the pagination logic to be more robust by using the `has_next_page` flag from the Jikan API.
- **FIX:** Fixed a `KeyError: 'NO TAGS'` in `autoinsert3.py` by ensuring 'NO TAGS' is included in the `insert_tags.sql` file generated by `tagcatcher.py`.
- **DOCS:** Updated `README.md` with a more detailed and clearer "Set up the database" section, outlining two distinct paths for database setup and seeding.
- **DOCS:** Updated `project_overview.md` to reflect the new data seeding workflow with `autoinsert3.py`.
- **BUILD:** Created `auto insert to db/requirements.txt` listing Python dependencies (`aiohttp`, `tqdm`).
- **FEAT:** Updated Python data seeding scripts for enhanced performance and robustness:
    - Renamed `autoinsert2.py` to `autoinsert3.py`.
    - Integrated map creation logic into `autoinsert3.py`, making it more self-contained.
    - Implemented asynchronous API calls using `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for faster data fetching in `autoinsert3.py` and `studiocatcher2.py`.
    - Updated pagination logic in `autoinsert3.py` to use `has_next_page` for reliability.
    - Introduced `studiocatcher2.py` and `studiomapcreator2.py` for updated studio data processing.
- **DOCS:** Updated `README.md` to include detailed instructions for installing Python dependencies via `requirements.txt` and revised database setup steps for both manual SQL execution and full data seeding from scratch.
- **DOCS:** Updated `project_overview.md` to reflect the new Python data seeding scripts (`studiocatcher2.py`, `studiomapcreator2.py`, `autoinsert3.py`) and their asynchronous processing, clarifying the updated workflow and dependencies.
- **DOCS:** Added a note to `README.md` advising users to delete previously generated SQL and map files before running Python data seeding scripts to avoid complications.
- **FEAT:** Created `randomcomments.py` to generate random comments for a subset of animes, and updated it to generate 500 unique comments spread across 500 animes.
- **DOCS:** Updated `README.md` and `project_overview.md` to include information about the `randomcomments.py` script and the `insert_comments.sql` file.
